Encoder todo:
- PV vs. IV vs. NV choices (could be pushed off by defaulting to PV if necessary)
- float sizes
- float dumping endianness
- Testing on 5.8.5
- More tests
- checksumming
- protocol version handling / exposure
- OO interface for decoder

Decoder todo:
- Review for memory leaks. Need a way to make sure allocated SV's are freed
  appropriately on error without using sv_2mortal on everything.
- Review for refcount leaks: Need to make sure that we arent returning things
  with artificially high refcounts.

v2 / optional in v1:
- optimize decoder
- more profiling?
- optimize dumpiv?
- blessv
- NUMLIST?
- stable hash order option
