- PV vs. IV vs. NV choices (defaulting to PV if necessary now)
- float sizes
- float dumping endianness
- checksumming?
- Gather experience with protocol version handling / exposure

- Decoder should have a way to prevent corrupted utf8,
  maybe via a UTF8 validation level option:
    0: no validation
    1: utf8 well-formedness validation (invalid byte sequences)
    2: utf8 code point validation (invalid code points)

- full, performant java implementation

v2:
- more profiling?
- optimize dumpiv?
- NUMLIST?
- stable hash order option
- limited streaming support?
