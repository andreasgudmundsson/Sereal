=head1 NAME

Sereal - A binary serialization format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This repository is the home of the Sereal data serialization format. This
format was started because the authors had technical reasons for producing
a better Storable.

Before we embarked on this project we had a look at various prior art. This
included a review of Google Protocol Buffers and of the MessagePack protocol.
Neither suited our needs so we designed this, liberally borrowing ideas from
the other projects.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 OBJECTIVES

=over 4

=item References

We wanted to be able serialize shared references properly. Many
serialization formats do not support this out of the box. 

=item Weak References

Perl has the concept of a special type of reference called a
"weakref" which is used to create cyclic reference structures which do
not leak memory. We need to handle these structures.

=item Aliases

Perl supports aliases which are a special kind of reference which is 
effectively a C level pointer instead of a Perl level RV. We needed 
to be able to represent these as well.

=item Objects

Blessing a reference can be dangerous in some circumstances. We needed 
to be able to serialize objects safely and reliably, and we wanted a
sane control mechanism for doing so.

=item Regexp Objects

In Perl, a regexp is a native type. We wanted to be able serialize these
at a native level without losing data such as modifiers.

=item Space Efficiencies

We want to be able to represent common structures as small as is
reasonable. Although not to the extreme that this makes the protocol
error prone. This includes such thing as removing redundancy from the
serialized structure (such as hash keys or classnames) automatically.

=item Speed Efficiencies

We want to be able to serialize and deserialize quickly. Some of the design
decisions and trade-offs were aimed squarely at performance.

=item Separate Decoder and Encoder

We wanted to separate the functions of serializing from deserializing
so they could be upgraded independently.

=item Forward/Backward Compatibility

We wanted the protocol to be robust to forward/backwards compatibility
issues. It should be possible to partially read new formats with an
old decoder, and possibly output old formats with a new decoder.
