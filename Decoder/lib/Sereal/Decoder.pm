=head1 NAME

Sereal::Decoder - Fast, compact, powerful binary deserialization

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sereal::Decoder qw(decode_sereal);
  
  my $decoder = Sereal::Decoder->new({...options...});
  
  my $structure;
  $decoder->decode($blob, $structure); # deserializes into $structure
  
  # or if you don't have weakrefs to the top level structure, this works, too:
  $structure = $decoder->decode($blob);
  
  # alternatively functional interface:
  decode_sereal($blob, {... options ...}, $structure);
  $structure = decode_sereal($blob, {... options ...});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This is an experimental module. The interface may change without notice.
Before using it in production, please get in touch with the authors!>

This library implements a deserializer for an efficient, compact-output,
and feature-rich binary protocol called I<Sereal>.
Its sister module L<Sereal::Encoder> implements an encoder for this format.
The two are released separately to allow for independent and safer upgrading.

The Sereal protocol version that is compatible with this decoder implementation
is currently protocol version 1. As it stands, it will refuse to attempt to
decode future versions of the protocol, but there is likely going to be an
option to decode the parts of the input that are compatible with version 1
of the protocol. The protocol was designed to allow for this.

Right now, the protocol specification can be found in the F<srl_protocol.h>
header file within this distribution. The specification might be moved to
documentation at a later date.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new

Constructor. Optionally takes a hash reference as first parameter. This hash
reference may contain any number of options that influence the behaviour of the
encoder. Currently, no such options are defined, but will be in a later release.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=head2 decode

Given a byte string of Sereal data, the C<decode> call derializes that data
structure. The result can be obtained in one of two ways: C<decode> accepts
a second parameter, which is a scalar to write the result to, AND C<decode>
will return the resulting data structure.

The two are subtly different in case of data structures that contain weak
references to the root element. In that case, the return value will be
a (non-recursive) copy of the weakened reference. The pass-in style is
more correct. In other words,

  $decoder->decode($sereal_string, my $out);
  # is almost the same but safer than:
  my $out = $decoder->decode($sereal_string);

=head1 EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

=head2 decode_sereal

The functional interface that is equivalent to using C<new> and C<decode>.
Expects a byte string to deserialize as first argument, optionally followed
by a hash reference of options (see documentation for C<new()>). Finally,
C<decode_sereal> supports a third parameter, which is the output scalar
to write to. See the documentation for C<decode> above for details.

The functional interface is marginally slower than the OO interface since
it cannot reuse the decoder object.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

The exact performance in time and space depends heavily on the data structure
to be serialized. For ready-made comparison scripts, see the
F<author_tools/bench.pl> and F<author_tools/dbench.pl> programs that are part
of this distribution. Suffice to say that this library is easily competitive
in both time and space efficiency with the best alternatives.
